## Description
In this challenge we needed to build a backend to handle an e-commerce site. I looked at previous assignments and added the folders I thought I would need. Tried to look at the mini project alot and pull from. In our instructions for the assginent we built up the models first Category, Product, ProductTag, and Tag. We built the accosications in the index for models(many/one, one/one ect.).
We then worked to gert the api routes to function.
