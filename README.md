## Description
In this challenge we needed to build a backend to handle an e-commerce site. I looked at previous assignments and added the folders I thought I would need. Tried to look at the mini project alot and pull from. In our instructions for the assginent we built up the models first Category, Product, ProductTag, and Tag. We built the accosications in the index for models(many/one, one/one ect.).
We then worked to gert the api routes to function. 

## Usage
This application is used to store info about a user and their thoughts, it simulates the info neede to back a social media platform 

## Installation
After running npm i, npm run seed, npm run start, I have had the routes working in insomnia.
